For some reason OS X may give you the following (other times it works fine):

    /System/Library/Extensions/msdosfs.kext failed to load - (libkern/kext) not privileged; check the system/kernel logs for errors or try kextutil(8).

when running make empty-disk. Sounds straight-forward to correct this run:

    sudo kextload /System/Library/Extensions/msdosfs.kext

then you can run make empty-disk correctly.
