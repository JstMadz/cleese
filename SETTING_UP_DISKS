Quick instructions on getting things going. I am assuming a lot is already
done before even running make. This has only been tested on OS X 10.5.X with
a custom built toolchain (binutils-2.19/gcc-4.2.4). Buyer beware at this point.

make
make grub.img
make cleese.img

In VirtualBox, create an other/other VM (no harddrive)

Add both grub.img and cleese.img as floppies in Virtual Media Manager.

Mount grub.img as floppy and boot.

Once you have the prompt ready change the floppy to cleese.img. Then type in
the shell:

    setup (fd0)
    reboot

From that point on, just booting cleese.img floppy will work.
