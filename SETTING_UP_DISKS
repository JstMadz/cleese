Quick instructions on getting things going. I am assuming a lot is already
done before even running make. This has only been tested on OS X 10.5.X with
a custom built toolchain (binutils-2.19/gcc-4.2.4). Buyer beware at this point.

make
cat boot/grub/stage1 boot/grub/stage2 > grub.img
hdiutil create -size 5M -fs "MS-DOS" -layout NONE cleese

Open cleese.dmg in the finder and copy KERNEL.BIN and boot to the disk image.
Unmount the disk image from the finder.

In VirtualBox, create an other/other VM (no harddrive)

Add both grub.img and cleese.dmg as floppies in Virtual Media Manager.

Mount grub.img as floppy and boot.

Once you have the prompt ready change the floppy to cleese.dmg. Then type in
the shell:

    setup (fd0)

It should tell you it was successful at this task. Restart the VM and voila.
