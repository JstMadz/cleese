After you have built the custom toolchain for i386-elf, run

(cd hello_world; make)
(cd echo; make)
make images

In VirtualBox, create an other/unknown VM (no harddrive)

Add both grub.img and cleese.img as floppies in Virtual Media Manager.

Mount grub.img as floppy and boot.

Once you have the prompt ready change the floppy to cleese.img. Then type in
the shell:

    setup (fd0)
    reboot

From that point on, just booting cleese.img floppy will work.

If you rebuilt any kernels, run make update-image to update cleese.img
