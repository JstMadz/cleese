After you have built the custom toolchain for i386-elf, run

make grub.img
make empty-disk

In VirtualBox, create an other/unknown VM (no harddrive)

Add both grub.img and empty.img as floppies in Virtual Media Manager.

Mount grub.img as floppy and boot.

Once you have the prompt ready change the floppy to cleese.img. Then type in
the shell:

    setup (fd0)

Then run

	make

which will build the various kernels and create cleese.img.

From that point on, just booting cleese.img floppy will work.

If you rebuilt any kernels, run make update cleese.img
