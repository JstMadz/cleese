Cleese is a project to build a functioning operating system written almost
entirely in Python. The basic idea is to have a microkernel mostly based on
the Python VM and all other operating system functionality written in Python.

James Tauber and Dave Long successfully built a proof-of-concept back in 2003.

You can see that work, along with some historical information at:

This is a reboot of the project, starting largely from scratch. James Tauber
is now joined by Brian Rosner.

To get started, see BUILDING_TOOLCHAIN and SETTING_UP_DISKS.
