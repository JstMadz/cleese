make
cat boot/grub/stage1 boot/grub/stage2 > grub.img
hdiutil create -size 5M -fs "MS-DOS" -layout NONE cleese

Open cleese.dmg in the finder and copy KERNEL.BIN and boot to the disk image.
Unmount the disk image from the finder.

cp cleese.dmg cleese.img

(Assuming you have a custom VM setup in VMWare Fusion) Set the floppy to
grub.img. Boot it up. You will be dropped in a grub shell. Note the version is
0.96 (I obtained the newer version of GRUB from ftp://alpha.gnu.org:21//gnu/grub/grub-0.97-i386-pc.tar.gz)
I am not sure why the version shows 0.96 in VMWare.

Once you have the prompt ready change the floppy to cleese.img. Then type in
the shell:

    setup (fd0)

It should tell you it was successful at this task. Restart the VM and viola.
